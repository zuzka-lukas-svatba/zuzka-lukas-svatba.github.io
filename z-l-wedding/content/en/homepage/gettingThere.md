If you are not from Bruntál and arrival on Saturday morning is impossible, you can arrive on Friday. You can sleep in the summer house in Milotice nad Opavou (close to Bruntál), dinner, breakfast, and transportation to the ceremony included. Just let us know if and when you plan to arrive so we can organise it properly.
