Concerning the gifts, money is preferred (Euros are fine :sweat_smile:).

If you want to give something more personal, please ask us first.

There will be lots of food and drinks, including beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages. But please **bring your own liquor**, based on your personal preferences.

If you want to sleep in the summer house in Milotice nad Opavou, definitely bring a sleeping bag. If you can also bring your tent, bring it and let us know, it will help us organise things.

There are facilities in the summer house, so you donâ€™t need to worry about water or a toilet.
