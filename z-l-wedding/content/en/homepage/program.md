The ceremony will be held in Bruntál Château, and afterwards, the reception will be held in Milotice nad Opavou. Please, let us know if you need transportation.

After the ceremony, you can spend some time walking around the château gardens. Or if you like, we can organise a tour of the château (in English, of course). Let us know if you are interested.

The wedding reception will be held in Milotice nad Opavou. We are preparing a short programme, but the main point is to chill and have fun. For children there will be a special programme, so they will not be bored at the table. You can expect lots of food and drinks, which include beer, wine, and non-alcoholic beverages. However, please bring your own liquor, based on your personal preferences.

There will be an option for accommodation right in Milotice nad Opavou at the summer house. Please let us know if you need to sleep over. Just be aware that the summer house will not fit all of us. So, expect the possibility of sleeping under the tent or tepee. However, all the necessary facilities are there. If you have your own tent and can bring it with you, let us know.
