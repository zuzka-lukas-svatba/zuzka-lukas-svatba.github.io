However, the ceremony will be held in Brunt치l Ch칙teau, and afterwards, the reception will be held in Milotice nad Opavou. Please, let us know if you need transportation.

After the ceremony, you can spend some time walking around the ch칙teau gardens. Or if you like, we can organise a tour of the ch칙teau (in English, of course). Let us know if you are interested.

The wedding reception will be held in Milotice nad Opavou. We are preparing a short programme, but the main point is to chill and have fun. For children there will be a special programme, so they will not be bored at the table.

There will be an option for accommodation right in Milotice nad Opavou at the summer house. Please let us know if you need to sleep over. Just be aware that the summer house will not fit all of us. So, expect the possibility of sleeping under the tent or tepee. However, all the necessary facilities are there. If you have your own tent and can bring it with you, let us know.
